  <h1>The Simpsons Movie</h1>
  <!-- Had to put a h1 in, as this is the main title of my page. It needs to stand out. -->

<h2><a class="links" href ="Meet the Cast.html">Meet the Cast</a></h2>
<!-- I linked my homepage to my second page (meet the cast). I put the link in a heading element so, it will stand out better. I put my link in a class element, as I didn't want every link I have to look the same. -->

<h2>America's most loved cartoon family hits the big screen!</h2>

<!-- Put another H2 as I wanted it to be a subheading, and a sort of introduction as to what the paragraph is going to be about below -->

<p>
In the most eagerly anticipated animated movie of all time, disaster is on the horizon in Springfield. When Homer dumps some rubbish into an already polluted lake, the whole of Springfield turn on the Simpson's. As the town of Springfield hangs in the balance, it is up to Homer to redeem himself and save Springfield from a human disaster.

<!-- Put a paragraph element in. This is for the synopsis of the film and what it is about -->

  <!-- Here, I put in my video element. I inserted the trailer of the actual film. I inserted the 'controls' button inside the element which means I will be able to click pause and play on the video.
  I also put a poster image in which will act as the front cover for my video. I also put 3 different types of the same video in 3 video formats which were MP3, WEBM, and OGG.
  I put three different video formats in, in case a particular browser does not support one of them. I also included a fallback message for the user, so they know what to do if they can't access the video. -->
